<p>In unit 6 we looked into using questionnaires as a tool for
gathering data. The focus was on designing a suitable questionnaire in
the context of the research in question.
In the past I have used a questionnaire for colleacting data in the
context of an academic research with responses captured in a Likert
scale. Despite having experience with it, studying again design
considerations was a good activity to refresh my knowledge on it. <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Data Collection -
Think about which data collection tool will be suitable for your area
of investigation (in this module and/or in your Project module). How
will you collect it and what analysis would you hope to perform? How
will this answer your research question? This should also be included
in the presentation of your Project Proposal in Unit 10.</span><br>

Transmitting fake signals to aircraft to cause an activation of the
traffic collision and avoidance system which would result in the
aircraft maneuvering to avoid the fake target. Extrapolating this idea
another possibility would be to involve fake targets between actual
traffic and though a series of inputs cause the fake targets to move
and create a scenario in which actual aircraft perform a series of
evasive maneuvers which lead them to an actual collision. The data
collection would be based on gathering data from actual simulations
using the Eurocontrol CAVEAT software which emulates the behaviour of
aircraft in collision situations using TCAS. <br>
For investigating the first hypothesis , data can be gathered regarding
the activation flags of TCAS in the presence of validated opposite
threats which correspond to fake targets. This would show that a series
of fake targets indeed activate TCAS within certain parameters of time
proximity leading to a second state in which TCAS responds with a
resolution advisory.<br>
For investigating the second hypothesis, data can be gathered with
respect to scenarios in which fake targets are projected between actual
traffic to try to lead the actual traffic to a collision. In such a
simulation scenario data on the CPA (closest point of approach) can be
collected an analysed. A CPA corresponding up to twice the size of the
aircraft from a central point would correspond to a collision whereas
higher CPAs would correspond to a near miss. <br>
Collecting data from the two scenarios would hopefully show whether the two hypothesis are accepted or rejected. <br>
