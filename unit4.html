<p>In unit 4 we looked into various tools and resources used in threat
modelling and management and applied those in different scenarios
through the seminar activities.Additional to the models described in unit 3 the OWAS threat modelling cookbook was presented. 
There was wide discussion on qualitative vs quantitative methods and
the introducion of Open FAIR, Octave, ISO and NIST frameworks.&nbsp;</p>Unit 4 Activity<br>
Read Shostack (2018) chapters 3 â€“ 5 (that cover STRIDE and DREAD,
Attack Trees and Attack libraries) as well as Spring et al (2021) (that
discusses the history and some failings with CVSS) and then create a
threat model based on one of the following scenarios:<br>
<br>
- A large international airport based in the United States of America.<br>
- A large international bank based in the UK.<br>
- A large nuclear power station in France.<br>
<br>
You should use the Threat modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat
modelling Cookbook and the ATT&amp;CK libraries to inform your model
design. Be prepared to share and discuss your designs at the seminar
session this week.<br>
