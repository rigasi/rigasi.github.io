<p>In unit 6 we looked into the security of modern programming languages such as F#, Rust, Swift, and Python. As in unit 6 the final project submisison was planned the only additional activity was.</p>

</p>
<p>"Python is the best programming language for the 21st Century.
Discuss this from a perspective of security, ease of use,
maintainability, and functions and features. Compare the suitability of
Python in relation to the strengths and weaknesses of the Rust, Swift
and F#."</p>
<p>There is no doubt that python is a rather popular programming
language with certain advantages such as syntax simplicity, popularity
and versatility in use cases like data science and scripting and a
large community with multiple resources available and many tools such
as IDEs to support development. In sort because of its popularity and
simplicity python gained a high "market share" between programming
languages. Of course there are also certain drawbacks as python is
slower due to its line by line execution and dynamic typing features.
This translates also to a higher memory usage making it unsuitable for
mobile applications.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>In comparison, rust is more difficult to learn but has some
advantages such as error handling as it does not stop during runtime ,
rust is thread and memory safer than python and also does not need a
garbage collector at runtime. Rust is also gaining momentum and wider
audience over time and therefore more and more resources are available.
Rust is more secure than python and more suited for high applications
requiring higher performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with every other topic, the superiority of one language over the other highly depends on the intended application. Swift is also
a very secure language which was developed by apple and its the
predominant language used for developin iOS applications. Therefore for
someone intending to develop applications for apple systems swift would
be preffered over python which is not a strong candidate for mobile
applications.On the other hand F# is well suited for working with .NET and is also faster than python in terms of performance.  <br>
</p>
<p>As a conclusion the suitability of any language depends on the
development purpose and the specific requirements in terms of security,
required performance, and target operating systems/environments. Python
is for sure a very popular language and certainly one of the best
languages in the 21st century but that doesnt mean that it should be
the language of choice for everything.<br>
