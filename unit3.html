<p>In unit 3 we were introduced to programming languages , their
history and concepts but also on buffer overflow activities.
Additionally there was a team activity discussion on the security of
programming languages and on whether python is a secure programming
language.During unit 3 preparatory work on the design document for the team project was also carried out as shown below.  <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buffer Overflow Activity</span><br>
</p>
<p>Running the Python overflow file we can clearly see that there is an
IndexError (an overflow) as the for loop index is moving out of range.
Looking into the output of pylint we can see that no error is raised as
pylint does not check the logic of the for loop.</p>

Running the file we can see the overflow<br>
<img style="width: 538px; height: 135px;" alt="" src="images/overflow4.png"><br>
Which can be corrected by changing the index within limits<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Development Team Project: Design Document</span><br>
For developing the team project the team was assembled and we created the necessary workspace to work together as shown below.<br>

<br>
I volunteered on the task of analysing the proposed design using the
STRIDE framework in combination with RTMP , rapid threat model
prototyping technique (Hill,2022) to identify quickly zones of trust
and access level zones based on the trust boundaries of the system
design. Subsequently threats are identified by applying STRIDE and in
combination with OWASP's top ten adequate technical controls and
mitigations are planned.<br>
