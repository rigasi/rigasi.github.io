<p>The focus of unit 5 was an introducetion to industry and enterprise standards. We looked into a number of standards and ISO 31000. Of particular interest was the GDPR case study activity below: <br>
</p>GDPR Case Studies<br>
<small><small><small>There are several case studies from 2014 â€“ 2018
concerning GDPR related issues and breaches. Chose a case study (should
be unique to each student) and answer the following questions:<br>
<br>
</small></small></small>
<p><small><small><small>The case study chosen was the 2016 Crypto Ransomware Attack on a primary school.<br>
</small></small></small></p>
<p><small><small><small>Q: What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</small></small></small></p>
<p><small><small><small>A primary school became the victim of a crypto
ransomware attack and parts of the school's information systems had
been encrypted rendering files inaccessible. It was discovered that the
following GDPR aspects had not been taken care of:</small></small></small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><small><small>No adequate backups were in place</small></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><small>No procedures or policies were in place to deal with ransomware or viruses</small></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><small>No contracts with data processors were in place</small></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><small>Staff was not properly trained on security awareness<br>
    </small></small></small></li>
</ul>
<p><small><small><small>Q:How was it resolved?</small></small></small></p>
<p><small><small><small>Some data was permanently lost but a number of corrective actions were taken to avoid future breaches:</small></small></small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small><small><small>Staff training and security awareness trainings were conducted</small></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><small>A contract review process to ensure appropriate contracts with ICT suppliers was created</small></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><small>Ensure that only competent data processors deal with data<br>
    </small></small></small></li>
</ul>
<p><small><small><small>Q:If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?<br>
</small></small></small></p>
<small><small><small>With hindsight it is always easier to determine
what went wrong or what could have been done differently. It is a fact
that in organisations which are not directly related to GDPR or which
do not regularly deal with data the awareness of GDPR topics on an
senior managerial level can be quite low. Considering the number of
issues which any management of any organization needs to focus on it is
unavoidable that some things will fall between the cracks and not be
given appropriate priority.<br>
<br>
This case study reminded me of a breach we had with a previous employer
in which the management was aware that an auxiliary non productive file
server was exposed to the public internet but out of convenience we
never took appropriate securing measures. The server contained files of
no significant importance. Unfortunately someone was able to modify the
files maliciously and plant a ransomware which affected other
productive systems as well and in the end we had to deal with a real
breach senario. <br>
