<p>In unit 3 the focus was research design looking into research
strategies and methods for data collection and analysis. Exploratory,
conclusive, descriptive, qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods
were discussed as different research strategies in support of a
proposal.&nbsp;</p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activity- collaborative discussion conclusion</span><br>
I made two contributions to the forum, one regarding a case on abusive
workplace behavior and one regargind the autonomous weapon systems. In
the former, I highlighted how abuse is also an organisational issue
which seemed to be part of the DNA of this company in the specific
example, and how we need to look into such cases not as isolated
incidents but as them being part of the wider organisational culture. <br>
<br>

<br>
In&nbsp; the second one I participated in the discussion on whether
engineers disclosing malpractices violated their NDAs. I looked for
commentary on other cases and on how to balance on one hand the need
for secrecy and NDAs and on the other hand whistleblowing rules and
regulations. <br>
<br>

<br>
In the end I made a summary post capturing those discussions as well within my own thread. <br>
