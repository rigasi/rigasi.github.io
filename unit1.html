								<p>In unit 1 the discussion revolved around the case study of&nbsp; Kovaite and Stankevičienė on industry 4.0. The
collaboration discussion was about discussing the Industry 4.0 by
giving examples of Industry 4.0 applications and discussing the points
in the case study. In my initial post i concentrated on examples of
industry 4.0 applications from the autonomous vehicle industry and the
usage of drones and UAVs in commercial applications and the potential
risks which they might bring into the cyber security landscape.</p>
<p>Fellow classmates supplemented my post with similar points on self-driving vehicles and very interesting references to attack vectors which have been identified in the past. As
colleagues pointed out, Industry 4.0 technologies can introduce new
risks to our existing systems but at the same time they bring with them
new technologies which can mitigates those risks in novel ways. <br>
