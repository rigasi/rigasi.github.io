<p>The focus of unit 4 was on case studies, focus groups and
observations as data collection methods for mostly qualitative research.</p>
<p>As activity material there was a case study on privacy which was also discussed on the seminar.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><big>Privacy Case Study<br>
</big></h3>
<small><small><small>Ricardo works for the records department of his
local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to
files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher,
Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the
corresponding names” of some records.<br>
<br>
Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs
the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth
asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact
these people for more information and for permission to do further
study.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?</span><br>
<br>
As Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access he
should not release any related info such as the names and addresses as
this would violate a number of privacy provisions , including GDPR
provisions on data processing. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Suppose Ricardo
were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What
ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant
access to Beth?</span><br>
<br>
If Ricardo is responsible for determining allowable access to the files
it does not mean that he has the right and authority to disclose data.
These are two very distinctive ideas. For Ricardo to disclose data
there must be a process in place which legitimises sharing of data and
sets the conditions for it. It could be possible for example to share
data in an anonymised form or any other <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Should Beth be
allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the
Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are
the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?</span><br>
<br>
No, Beth should not contact the individuals as she is not authorised to
obtain their data and individuals have not given their consent. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Suppose Beth contacts the individuals
to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving
permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not
respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are
needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?</span></small></small></small><br>
<br>
The data can be used only for the purpose for which they have been
collected, Beth cannot use any of the data as their is no consent. She
cannot contact them to get additional approval as she has no right to
use their data for contacting them. <br>
