<p>The focus of unit 8 was on implementing quantitative risk models. I
found this to be the most difficult unit as I had no experience with
QRA. I did get some familiarity with Yasai which I used to implement
the
course text model. I had no chance to experiment with crystal
ball or other software.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Seminar Activities</span><br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:How do Goerlandt et al (2017)
suggest that the validity of QRA approaches can be validated? What did
they posit was the most effective approach?</span><br>
</p>
QRAs can also suffer from inconsistencies under several conditions and
this can be demonstrated when assessments are carried out by different
teams. It has been shown that the results of QRAs are weak in their
validation as analysis by different teams of the same problem with the
same tools leads to different results. The authors believe that QRA can
gelp making good decisions but scientific confirmation of these claims
would help to overcome dobts and criticisms about its efficacy. The
solution proposed is a collaborative QRA approach in which teams work
together on a QRA, this technique has the potential to lead to a more
solid QRA and also increase buy-in by stakeholders leading at least to
internal allignment.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:Which techniques did Hugo et al
(2018) should be applied to project management? What were their
recommendations to increase the use of QR analysis in Projects? </span><br>
Hugo et al (2018) found out that QRA tools have a positive impact on
project management although their adoption can depend on a number of
factors such as individual competence, organisational approach,
maturity levels and resources available for project and risk
management. Furthermore they also identified that to improve the use of
risk management tools it is recommended to increase the risk management
competence of individuals via training, to align the organisations
approach to risk management and to make available the required
resources to carry out risk management. <br>
<br>
Q:<span style="font-weight: bold;">The last paper reviews various
Multi-criteria decision methods (MCDMs) and considered the relative
accuracy and validity of the techniques. Which did they find was the
most accurate of the methods compared? What were the failings of the
general TOPSIS approach?<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Out of the methods
considered AHP has the best ranking results. A number of weaknesses
have been identified in the TOPSIS approach mainly related to the
spread of the data set and euclidean space assumptions, distance
calculations as well as raking indexes. Without iprovement in these
areas using TOPSIS for MCDM may lead to the wrong decisions. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reflection on Unit 8</span><br>
Some of the papers included as reading for this unit were arguably
complicated and above my current level of understanding of QRA topics.
Nevertheless I read them and some of them more than once trying to
understand the arguments which authors were trying to make. It is
indeed understandable that QRA is landscape full of different
methodologies, mathematics, probabilities, and ways to see the world.
If one invests an appropriate effort it is certainly possible to
understand QRAs and their considerations and therefore this was a reach
experience for me as I had the feeling that finally I do understand the
basics behind such methods and I am also in a position to compare and
contrast things. That was a great and joyful achievement. <br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Simulations with Yasai</span></p>
<p>Understanding Yasai was a little bit of a challenge but I played
around with a few different scenarios in the yasai tool and thankfully
a couple of youtube videos had good explanations on how to run models.
The seminar itself was also helpful in understanding what needs to be
done. I also found that Yasai documentation was mostly relevant for
people who have already used simulation software of some short and are
familiar with Monte Carlo techniques and focused&nbsp; first on
understanding how a simulation could be run in excel manually, without
using the Yasai plugin.Once a few rounds are run and once someone plays
around with the various inputs and outputs things make much more sense.
