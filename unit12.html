<p>In unit 12 the main debate was on what will be the most influential
trend in SRM in the years to come. As discussed in unit 11 , Group 5
was of the opinion that the most interesting trend for the future SRM
would me a combination of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
Naturally as the two fields are too wide we had to focus our efforts on
one of the two and therefore we picked Machine Learning as our lucky
candidate. It was interesting to see that some other groups also chose
ML/AI combinations and as expected this combination was the winning
candidate in the voting process. <br>
