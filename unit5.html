</h1>
<div class="content"><p>The focus of unit 5 was future trends in secure
software development by examining technologies such as fog computing,
IoT and cyber physical systems. I was particularly interested in the
concept of fog computing as I had not encountered it before during my
career. <br>

<p>Question 1<br>
Run the API.py code. Take a screenshot of the terminal output. What command did you use to run the code?</p>
<p><img style="width: 978px; height: 299px;" alt="" src="images/restapi1.png"><br>
Question 2<br>
Run the following command at the terminal prompt: w3m http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Ann<br>
<br>
What happens when this command is run, and why?</p>
<p><img style="width: 507px; height: 341px;" alt="" src="images/restapi2.png"></p>
<p>User Ann is retrieved as it exists in users<br>
</p>
<p>Question 3<br>
Run the following command at the terminal prompt: w3m http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Adam<br>
<br>
What happens when this command is run, and why?</p>
<p>User is not found as he is not included in the list of users</p>
<p>Question 4<br>
What capability is achieved by the flask library?</p>
<br>
<p>The flask library is used to create a back server for handling rest api requests</p>

</p>
<br>
<p>Based on your reading this week, could you write a section that
might be appended to this paper, Salah et al, 2016, which would present
the next phase of evolution history, from microservices to the
technologies which are commonly in use today?</p>
It is without doubt that microservices is an evolving trend which on a
large scale replaces monolithic architectures. Of course monolithic
architectures might not be replaced completely as they are still a
practical and efficient architectural layout for small applications or
systems and also prefered sometimes in smaller organisations who do not
have the technical understanding or confidence to work with developing
microservices applications for small projects. Potential future trends
in microservices could be an evolution towards a multi-runtime
architecture and perhaps a move towards miniservices or what people
term hybrid microservices. <br>
