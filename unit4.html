<p>In unit 4 we looked into various tools and resources used in threat
modelling and management and applied those in different scenarios
through the seminar activities.Additional to the models described in unit 3 the OWASP threat modelling cookbook was presented. 
There was wide discussion on qualitative vs quantitative methods and
the introducion of Open FAIR, Octave, ISO and NIST frameworks.&nbsp;</p>Unit 4 Activity<br>
Read Shostack (2018) chapters 3 – 5 (that cover STRIDE and DREAD,
Attack Trees and Attack libraries) as well as Spring et al (2021) (that
discusses the history and some failings with CVSS) and then create a
threat model based on one of the following scenarios:<br>
<br>
- A large international airport based in the United States of America.<br>
- A large international bank based in the UK.<br>
- A large nuclear power station in France.<br>
<br>
For this activity I chose a somewhat courageous scenario based on a
large international airport in the USA. In the particular example I did
not focus on IT but on security and the objective of the attack is to
board a plane with a 3D printed firearm. I wrote this attack tree after
reading <a href="https://time.com/5356179/3d-printed-guns-tsa/">this</a>
article stating that the TSA has found 3D printed guns at airport
checkpoints 4 times since 2016. As I have a background in the industry
I decided to try to map a potential attack on the attack tree below. It
was an interesting exercise as I thought that I can quickly create such
a diagram without too much effort but as I started drawing I started
thinking about the different attack vectors and interdependencies
between actors in the system and then I came up with much more content
than what I originally thought. I was luckly that I picked a relatively
simple scenario which resulted in somewhat decent tree and not
something extremely complex which could extend over several pages. At
the end of the day it didnt matter at all that the context was not IT
as through the exercise I think I understood how powerfull can attack
trees be. <br>

<p>Description:</p>
<p>The two main branches of the tree are either an individual bringing
a 3D firearm onboard illegaly himself or having an accomplish working
as an insider in the airport and bringing the firearm to our passenger
after he goes through security. In the first case there is the obvious
difficulty of acquiring such a firearm as it either needs to be bought
or constructed using advanced 3D printer devices. The latter is
preferred as 3D firearms contain some metalic parts which would trigger
a metal detector. Note that in this scenario the functioning of the
firearm is not of concern, a 3D printed gun could potentially be used
to hijack a plane by taking hostage a passenger and it is quite likely
that a properly 3D printed firearm can fire at least once succesfully
injuring or killing a passenger. <br>
</p>
Modern airports use a mixture of security gates including metal
detector ones and advanced imaging ones. The latter can detect a 3D
printed firearm but the metal detector ones can only detect one if it
contains metalic parts. The passenger needs to be lucky enough to avoid
also the random sampling check as metal detectors will every few rounds
beep a false positive to enforce a manual check by security
staff.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The second branch presuposses the existence of an insider which brings
the firearm to out passenger after the passenger goes through security
checks. This is also not easy as employees are also screened with metal
detectors and other devices and they are also subjected to background
checks and security clearances. The alternative would be for the
insider to violate the physical security of the airside by throwing for
example the firearm over the fence or finding another way to bring it
inside undetected. CCTV, fences, patrols, and surveillance of the
perimeter are some effective countermeasures. Additionally we can also
consider that a typical employee working inside the airport (eg.
check-in agent) would have great difficulty walking undetected to the
fence to pick up a firearm which he dropped before his shift started. <br>
<br>
The most probable scenario would be for a passenger printing his own 3d
firearm , going to the airport and selecting a queue in which there is
a simple metal detector and not an advanced imaging scanner. Then he
would only have to be lucky to avoid the random sampling of the metal
detector. <br>
