<p>The focus of unit 9 was business continuity and disaster recovery.
In
unit 9 the introduction to disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) by
Andrade et al (2017) is certainly a very attractive alternative for
enterprises which cannot afford expensive custom DR solutions. Before
designing any DR solution certain parameter like RTOs and DPOs need to
be defined and althought the definitions seem to be clear some more
thinking is required to put them into the proper context in a real life
situation. I made the following diagram to help me understand a
timeline of events in a potential disaster:</p><br>
<p><img style="width: 848px; height: 234px;" alt="" src="images/disaster.png"><br>
</p>
<br>
<p>As shown above, an RPO of 5 minutes means that from the moment the
disaster occurs we should be able to recover all data up to 5 minutes
before the disaster. A data loss of the last 5 minutes is acceptable.
At the same time , from the moment of a disaster taking place we should
be able to recover services within 5 minutes. It helps very much to be
able to plot the timeline since it can be confusing to have the same
RTO and RPO values and think that RPO counts from the moment the
disaster occured and forwards, which is not the case as demonstrated
above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides unit 9 material on BC/DR collaborative discussions continued
in the forums but it seemed to me the activity was somewhat lower as
week 12 is approaching with its final submission everyone seems to be
busy working on their projects. <br>
