<p>The focus of unit 7 was on quantitative risk modelling and methods
such as MC, Bayes based methods, MCDM , TOPSIS, AHP and ANP. This was
an exciting week for me as it was the first time I was introduced to
quantitative risk modelling methods. I have a background in risk
management for operations within the aeronautical industrywhich normally focuses on qualitative risk assessments mainly because of the complexity and data sets required for quantitative 
analysis. Of course quantitative analysis does happen in the industry,
but it is usually done by safety engineers on the side of aircraft
manufacturers, air navigation service providers (a.k.a air traffic
control) and insurace companies based on various models.&nbsp;</p><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Collaborative Activity</span><br>
The second colab activity was focused around the question of whether it
is time to change the CVSS based on the article by Spring et al (2021).
There were some quite interesting posts on the topic and overall my
argument has been that indeed an improvement is needed but perhaps the
industry is so much accustomed to CVSS that replacing it completely
with something new might be utopic, instead, there is room for
improvement of the existing CVSS scoring. <br>
<br>
What I found particularly interesting is that in those collab.
discussions the topics are always a bit biased with respect to the
original positions of the papers. All fellow students started their
posts by adopting the position by Spring et al and argueing deeply in
favour of it as it seems to be the right think to do in such an
assignment. I tried to differentiate myself from that and argue that
indeed there are weaknesses but CVSS is not as bad as Spring et al.
argue. So overall there was a bit of an element of psychological
groupthink in the forums or perhaps bias in favour of what seems to be
the most reasonable position to adopt. <br>
