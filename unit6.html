<p>The focus of unit 6 was on the practical implications of security and risk standards. A
number of standards were discussed such as GDPR and PCI-DSS but the
real highlight was in the team project and the Risk Identification
Report.</p><br>
Reflection on teamwork for Risk Identification Report<br>
<br>
Originally we were supposed to be 4 students in Group 5 but one of them
never showed up so all of us had to eventually do an extra chunk of
work. What I found particularly interesting was that the two other
students Yash and Patricia knew already eachother and had cooperated
before. This was an intresting dynamic because there was already a
group formed and I was just the new one onboard. In such situations I
always try to adapt to the norms of the existing group and I think its
really difficult to change such norms after they have been established.
This is something which concerned me a lot as I didnt want to appear to
be trying to change their habits and norms. Luckily their established
working pattern was convenient and flexible and I managed to adapt
well. What I noticed however is that despite the group being already
formed the group development dynamic were there quite in the way in
which Tuckman (1965) has desribed them.&nbsp; It tooks us a couple of
weeks and regular meeting to form as a team and probably we started
norming close to the submission deadline of the first assignment and
performing as a team during the work of the second assignment. What is
perhaps interesting to reflect on is that setting up such a group
online does follow Tuckmans model but the lack of physical contact and
communication perhaps makes the process a bit slower and the
development of trust takes longer time. <br>
<br>
In the forming phase we agreed on who will do what, I took over a more
project manager role as this is also my field in real life, this was
also reflected in our team contract:<br>

We also agreed on a regular meeting schedule every week and on using a
common google drive repository for our work. Our communications channel
was the whats app, sometimes communication was a bit challenging as
Patricia lives in Canada , Yash in India, and myself in Germany.<br>

<br>
Nevertheless, we managed to deliver on time and with good quality. Our
communication over whats app would always intensify close to the
submission dates and we should have exchanged hunderds of messages. <br>
