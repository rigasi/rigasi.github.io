<p>The focus of unit 2 was on defining a research proposal. Besides
defining the research question itself this unit raised interesting
topics such as the usefulness and contribution that each research
proposal ought to make. This might&nbsp; seem to be an obvious point
but I am sure that many choose their proposals considering what might
be easier rather than usefull.&nbsp;</p><br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Activity <br>
</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">Start planning your literature
review based on your chosen topic from the list provided in Unit 1.
Your outline of the literature review can be submitted for formative
feedback in Unit 4 before final submission in Unit 7. You can use the
guidance document for the outline submission and to prepare your review.<br>
<br>
You should also take some time to
consider your research proposal which could be based around the area
you have chosen to investigate in your literature review or the topic
of your capstone project (MSc students). Your outline of the proposal
can be submitted for formative feedback in Unit 8 before final
submission in Unit 10. Units 8 and 9 will be focussed on analysing data
which, along with research methods, will also need to be considered in
your presentation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Choosing a topic was not easy and I had to spend
some time and try to imagine how would I proceed based on a potential
choice. In the end I chose a more generic topic under the following
title: <span style="" lang="EN-GB">“The
use
of cloud computing for building effective information systems in the
aeronautical
industry”. My choice was based on the fact that I know the industry
very well and also I had a strong incentive to carry out some
literature review research in this area. One of the issues I
encountered was that there was a limited number of publications in the
field and two of them were of poor quality. I was surprised to find out
that work with so many inconsistencies could have been published. Poor
quality ranged from methodological errors to misleading information. <br>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I had carried out a
literature review in another field in the past and therefore I could
progress on a higher pace, nevertheless it is always a challenge
reviewing literature and understanding what might be relevant for the
research and where the literature gaps are.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><b><span style="" lang="EN-GB"> <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
