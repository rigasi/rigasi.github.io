<p>The focus of unit 5 was interviews and survey methods in the context
of research methods. Both seemed to be interesting tools. In the past I
have used surveys in carrying out a Thesis work but it was interesting
to see how interviews can be used as a research method in computer
science to collect qualitative feedback from users in support of
research. Collecting
, organising and analysing qualitative feedback seems to be a more
challenging task compared to quantitative analysis techniques. <br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Reflective Activity 2</p>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">In 2018, Cambridge
Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA
(Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from
millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous
surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably
participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys
used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this
happens often through various media.</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Consider how
exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further
examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of
all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and
professional standpoints that apply.</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
In 2018, Cambridge Analytica (CA) came under intense scrutiny for its
role in harvesting the personal data of millions of Facebook users
without their explicit consent. This data collection was facilitated
through seemingly harmless Facebook surveys created by Dr. Aleksandr
Kogan, a researcher from Cambridge University. Users who participated
in the survey were unwittingly granting access to not only their
personal data but also the data of their Facebook friends, a loophole
in Facebook's API at the time (Cadwalladr &amp; Graham-Harrison, 2018).
The primary intention behind this massive data collection effort was to
develop detailed psychological profiles of users to serve targeted
political advertisements, thereby potentially swaying voters in a
particular direction. This raised ethical concerns around informed
consent, personal privacy, and the manipulation of democratic
processes. <br>
<br>
Another notorious instance of inappropriate survey usage was when the
US retailer Target predicted a teen's pregnancy through her purchasing
patterns, leading them to send targeted baby product ads, thereby
inadvertently revealing her condition to her family (Duhigg, 2012).
This instance underscores the potency of data analytics, where
seemingly unrelated data points can reveal deeply personal information.<br>
<br>
From an ethical standpoint, both examples highlight the potential for
gross invasions of privacy. Not only is personal data collected without
clear consent, but it is also used in ways the individuals never
anticipated. Socially, these events contribute to an atmosphere of
mistrust towards tech companies and surveys, as individuals grow wary
of how their data will be used. Legally, such data breaches and misuses
prompt demands for stricter data protection laws. The General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU is a notable response, aiming to
give individuals better control over their data (Voigt &amp; Von dem
Bussche, 2017). Professionally, these incidents emphasize the necessity
for companies and researchers to prioritize data ethics and
transparency, as reputational damage from such events can be severe.<br>
