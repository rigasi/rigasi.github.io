<p>The focus of unit 2 was diving into the risk management process and
looking into the different types of assessments , qualitative vs
quantitative. <br>
</p>
<p>The unit 2 seminar focused on a discussion around Spears and Barki
(2010) on the two assessment types. Below are my notes from unit 2
activity:</p>
<h3>Unit 2 Seminar Activity</h3>
A.How did the authors use both Qualitative and Quantitative assessment approaches? What benefits did each approach yield?<br>
<br>
The authors used a large pool of users in order to approach everybody
involved in the process. Involving such a diverse group of people
provided a lot of data but also preserved an element of subjectivity in
the approach. <br>
<br>
B.What do the authors list as the advantages of involving users in the risk management process?<br>
You get multiple feedback from different sides and users feel that they
are involved in the process, they feel part of the process as disvussed
in the Buy-in theory of user participation (Markus and Mao 2004). User
participation also raises the organizational awareness of security
risks and controls within targeted business processes and facilitated
greater alignment of SRM with business objectives, values, and needs. <br>
<br>
C. Based on the findings of the research,<br>
<br>
C1. How will the lack of user access affect the risk assessment you will carry out as part of your assessment?<br>
A lack of user access will affect the outcome of the assessment as
users will not have enough feedback to relate to the business processes
and risk awareness. Without having access and without a understanding
of the processes/areas users might not be able to form a complete
picture and therefore participate in the risk assessment effectively.<br>
<br>
C2. Will it affect the choice of Qualitative vs. Quantitative assessment methods you utilise?<br>
Without sufficient user input it is not possible to conduct a
qualitative assessment which is more subjective and opinion based than
a quantitative assessment. <br>
<br>
C3. How might you mitigate any issues encountered?<br>
Especially with respect to qualitative assessments tacit knowledge and
pre-conception/biases are important as they can have an impact on the
risks identified as well as their classification. As an element of
subjectivity will always remain it is important to consider especially
any biases which can lead to locking in/focusing on specific ideas and
risks and therefore missing the big picture. <br>
