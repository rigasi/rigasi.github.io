<p class="MsoNormal">Unit 11 focused on developing an e- Portfolio. As I have worked systematically throu<span style="" lang="EN-GB">ghout
the course , collecting the necessary bits and pieces of information was not
difficult. I revisited each unit and my notes to reflect on what I have learned
in each unit, areas with which I struggled and areas in which I have developed.
Here are some key notes from my Journey:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Literature
review:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">This has
been a very good exercise in synthesising information and consolidating
arguments. Arguably literature review is a time consuming task which requires
good organisational skills and the ability to organise knowledge in different
domains so as to be in a position to synthesise arguments. The tasks of
identifying gaps in existing knowledge and being critical of the work of others
is always demanding and sometimes it inevitable stretches the boundaries of our
own understanding of knowledge. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Research Proposal:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">This was yet
another demanding exercise as it had to be realistic and it required partly
some serious research. I chose a very complex but interesting topic in the field
of cyber security in physical systems, namely, in air traffic control. Due to
the complexity of the topic I spent an excessive amount of time in the
technical details of it and in literature review and thus I did not have
sufficient time for the actual presentation. I could develop my arguments but I
should have invested more time in polishing it and also on the content itself ,
to be more critical of my methodology , existing literature review etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">E-portfolio:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The format
of my e-portfolio is more like a diary with reflective touches than anything
else. This format has served me well in the past and I know that it might not
be the preferred format but it works for me as it enables me to look back into
the challenges I encountered in each unit and reflect on those. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
