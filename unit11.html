<p>In unit 11 we focused on new and emerging trends in the field of
SRM. The main trends identified in the bibliography were the options
theory approach, behavioral operations, machine learning and artificial
intelligence, enterprise risk management, and the importance of
selecting a framework for risk management. With the exception of
enterprise risk management all the other trends identified were new for
me and I found machine learning and artificial intelligence
particularly interesting. In group 5 this was the technology we decided
to present as a future trend and therefore we invested some time
reading through a number of sources and highlight opportunities and
risks related to machine learning. We presented our findings in Unit
12. <br>
</p>
<p>Unit 11 Reflection</p>
<br>
<p>As technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence
are advancing the question of how such technologies will be used in the
future remains. What is the fate of aggregated data collected by all of
us using out IoT devices, mobile phones, social media platforms. and
the internet? The internet which at one point was seen as the medium to
provide access to information for the repressed and to give the
possibility to any of us to have our own voice , seems to become a
dystopia dominated by a few companies controlling most of the access to
our own data. In this strange world what will be the role for
technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence? Looking
at more authoritarian regimes like China, we know that surveilance at a
mass level belongs to one of the strongest weapons in the arsenal of
the CCP. Traditionally such surveilance required extensive resources
and participation of the public either in the form of secret police
organisations or by employing grassroots informants (Pan, 2020). In the
age of digital surveilance such mechanisms are supplemented by the data
we provide (willingly or unwillingly) by using our mobile devices,
social media platforms, communication applications etc. Aggregated data
can lead to powerful inference capabilities and a disadvantage against
the citizens who are unaware of the new aggregation capabilities of the
state and novel techniques for mass surveillance (Pan,2020). To quote
directly Meng Jianzhu, the former secretary of the Chinese Central
Political and Legal Affairs “AI will drastically improve the
predictability, accuracy and efficiency of social management. (Pan,
2020, p170). And if more authoritarian regimes use such techniques for
mass surveillance what is really happening in the rest of the world? As
citizens do we really have sufficient transparency and visibillity into
how far our own governments are using large scale data aggregations for
their own agendas and purposes? Are regulatory initiatives such as GDPR
really in a position to address such abuses of power or is technology
advancing at a pace which makes it impossible to keep up with such
developments from a regulatory perspective? <br>
</p>
<p>To bring some counter arguments in the discussion it is a know fact
that AI and ML technologies are (for the time being at least) not
perfect. And even if we would have the perfect algorithms in place we
need to understand not only the technologies involved but also the
dynamics of authoritatian politics in the long run. As Jan puts it
(Jan,2020):</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">"If we believe everything we
read in the news, we might believe that our world is on the verge of a
dramatic and possibly terrible change because of artifical intelligence
and new computational technologies. If we read political science research, aside from research on social media, computational technologies might as well not matter"</span></p>
<p>And it seems that the truth is somewhere in the middle. Much like
promises made in other technological areas, it is only few times in
which the technological adoption velocity matches reality. Few years
ago we were promised that in the future cars will drive us around on
their own and that vertical take-off and landing vehicles could be a
daily reality in our cities. The reality is rather different of course
with significant advances for autonomous vehicles which however
encounter strong difficulties in the regulatory field of safety. In the
end it is important to ask those questions and remain critical of
extravagant promises but also reject the complacent narrative in which
the world never changes. <br>
