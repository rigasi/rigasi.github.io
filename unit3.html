<p>In unit 3 different approached to threat modelling were introduced.
I was mostly aware of STRIDE and DREAD but I have never used attack
trees or PASTA. <br>
</p>
<p>The Threat Modeling Manifesto (Shostack et al, 2020) was an
interesting adaptation of the agile manifesto in risk management
processes whereas the paper by Shevchenko et al (2018) offered a very
interesting summary of threat modelling methods which can be used in
different parts of development processes. The threat modelling tool by
microsoft is a free platform which can be used for carrying out threat
modelling activities. I
played around quite a bit with it and I used it in a couple of threat
modelling exercises at work with good results overall. I am sure there
are other tools out there with great capabilities but this was a kind
of free of charge solution for playing around with threat modelling.
Reflecting on unit 3 I think that I do understand the differences
between the threat modelling methods but I certainly need to play
around with the tools and try to apply each one of them in a particular
situation to internalise the mechanisms behind them and get a better
understanding of what can be used and where. <br>
