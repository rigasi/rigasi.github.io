<p class="MsoNormal">In unit 8 we looked into different analysis for
quantitative data. We looked at statistical inference, datasets,
dispersion, variables, hypothesis testing. I did not spend too much
time into it as since this is my second master's and I have used
statistical inference as my main analytical tool in the past. What has
been slightly different was the tooling as last time I worked with SPSS. I carried out the exercises mainly to familiarise
myself with the possibilities in excel. In parallel I also <span style="" lang="EN-GB"><span style="">continued with the discussions in the Unit 7 forum:</span></span></p>

<big><big>Exercise 8.1</big></big><br>
Solved xls file <a href="files/Exe%208.1B.xlsx">here</a><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Open the Excel workbook in Exe
8.1B.xlsx from the Exercises folder. Obtain the sample size, sample
mean weight loss and the sample standard deviation of the weight loss
for Diet B. Place these results in the block of cells F23 to F25, using
the same format as that employed for the Diet A results in the above
example.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Briefly interpret your findings. What
do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two
weight-reducing diets?</span><br>
<br>
Answer:<br>
Diet B n=50 Mean= 3.710 SD= 2.769.<br>
The sample size is 50 people, the sample mean loss for diet B is 3.7 kg
and the standard deviation is 2.760 kg. Compared to diet A diet B
appears to be less effective as it was less succesful. Additional tests
would be needed to establish the statistical significance of this
suggestion. <br>

</span>Solved xls file <a href="files/Exe%208.2B.xlsx">here</a><br>
<span lang="EN-GB">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Open the Excel
workbook in </span><b style="font-style: italic;">Exe 8.2B.xlsx</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> from the
Exercises folder. Obtain the sample median, first and third quartiles and the
sample interquartile range of the weight loss for Diet B. Place these results
in the block of cells F26 to F29, using the same format as that employed for
the Diet A results in the above example.</span><o:p></o:p></span><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p><br>

effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?</span><o:p style="font-style: italic;"></o:p></span><span style="font-style: italic;">

</span><br>
<br>
Based on the provided statistics, Diet A appears to be more effective
in terms of average weight loss compared to Diet B. However, it's worth
noting that the results for Diet B seem to have a bit more variability,
as indicated by its higher standard deviation and IQR.<br>
<br>
Mean Weight Loss:<br>
Diet A has a higher mean weight loss compared to Diet B, suggesting that on average, individuals on Diet A lost more weight.<br>
<br>
Median Weight Loss:<br>
The median for Diet A is also higher than Diet B, further suggesting
that the central tendency of weight loss for Diet A is greater than
Diet B.<br>
<br>
Standard Deviation:<br>
Diet B has a slightly higher standard deviation than Diet A, implying
that the weight loss results for Diet B are more spread out or varied
than those for Diet A.<br>
<br>
Interquartile Range:<br>
The IQR for Diet B is slightly higher than Diet A, which again suggests
a greater spread between the 25th and 75th percentiles for Diet B
compared to Diet A.<br>
<br>
Quartiles:<br>
The quartiles suggest that 75% of people on Diet A lost up to 7.033
units (could be pounds, kilograms, etc.), while 75% of people on Diet B
lost up to 5.404 units. Additionally, 25% of people on Diet A lost at
least 3.748 units, while 25% of people on Diet B lost at least 1.953
units.<br>

Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about
the patterns of brand preferences for each of the two demographic areas?<br>
<br>
In Area 2 brands A and B are more popular. In Area 1 however other brands are more popular. <br>

of course depends on the assumption that the sample is representative of the
population. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
